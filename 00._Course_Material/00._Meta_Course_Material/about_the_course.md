# About this Course: **Full Stack Node.js**

Reflect on the course's title.  Besides Node.js it is:

- UX is important. Always think before you code. We have a code first approach in class because we are constrained by time. This is not ideal.
- Understanding the relationship between backend and frontend is crucial.  


## Course Components

### Lectures

This course is based on live coding. If you run into problems then ask me for more time or help. 

If I evaluate that the lecture must proceed then please drop it and debug later. 

I don't want you to lose out on important new information.

Here are some useful tips regarding [debugging](/00._Course_Material/00._Meta_Course_Material/debugging_tips.md).

### Homework

- Weekly exercises that you must hand-in. Once the hand-in closes in Fronter it won’t reopen. 

### Hand-in Procedure

- Git link to the relevant folder. 

### Mandatories

Prerequisite to go to the exam.

#### Mandatory I:

- The weekly homework has been handed-in or a 1 page report on the topic for each missed hand-in. 
- Contains write-ups about the topics we go through in class in depth. So better start taking notes and writing these things down weekly. I won’t give you the topics so part of the exercise is to research what to write about and collect the info. 
- Done with HTML. Requires a dummy login/sign up form.


#### Mandatory II:

- Done with Svelte or other web frameworks. 
- Focuses on authentication and authorization in frontend and backend. 


### Exam Project

Solo or in groups. This is a large full-stack project that is different from the other projects. The requirements are basic so consider something you really want to build and put the hours into. A solid project is a good start for the exam.

- Must include the auth from mandatory II. 

It is a requirement that your code follows clean code practices. Consider setting up a [linter](/00._Course_Material/00._Meta_Course_Material/linters_overview.md) early in the course so that you can get accustomed to working with them.

## Additional Notes

### Communication

-  I really hope that people will be active on Teams. For all communication use the class channel in Teams for transparency. @ me so I can see if you have typed a question there. 

Besides deeply personal matters all communication should be in the Teams channel. This create transparency and gives everyone the ability to see the discussion and my answers. 

### Co-pilot Usage

Co-pilot is an excellent tool and I recommend that you use it in your future endeavours but for this course I highly recommend that you refrain from using it. Arguments:
  - Rather than focusing on its suggestion you should focus on understanding the syntax. 
  - During the exam you will be live coding and co-pilot is not an option.
